The *.slvr JSON files can be read by the interactive calculator
Soulver3. Soulver3 evaluates arithmetic expressions, binds variables,
and immediately recalculates the value of all expressions/variables in
the file on any edit (think spreadsheet, but in a textual format).

 anything beyond the material shown on the slides.]
