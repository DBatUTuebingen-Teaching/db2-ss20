heap.c

Map a MonetDB tail file (persistent representation of a column
vector) and the associated string dictionary file into memory and print
its contents.  Assumption: the tail file contains offsets into the
string dictionary, i.e., the associated BAT is of type bat[:str].

Adapt the definition of macros TAIL and HEAP to point to your actual
.tail and .theap files (recall MAL command bat.info()).

Compile via

  cc -Wall -O2 heap.c -o heap

Execute via

  ./heap
